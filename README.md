# MonoInjectionTemplate

In this tutorial I hope to provide some education on Unity, in particular, making a very basic mono cheat. My experience with unity have been a very positive one, and I encourage anyone who is new to game hacking to get into unity, at the very least, snoop around in DnSpy. The fundamentals of game engines are very easy to learn by reading though unity assemblies.
