# MonoInjectionTemplate

Update 9.28.2021: The text and video tutorials have been removed as the company who's game I used as an example did not want that information publically shared. No changes have been made to the code here, it is still *universal*.

In this tutorial I hope to provide some education on Unity, in particular, making a very basic mono cheat. My experience with unity have been a very positive one, and I encourage anyone who is new to game hacking to get into unity, at the very least, snoop around in DnSpy. The fundamentals of game engines are very easy to learn by reading though unity assemblies.
